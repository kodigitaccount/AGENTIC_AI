^^^^ Workshop on Agentic AI ^^^^^
2025 -- agentic ai dominant the world 
 session is live --- Nareshit Youtube 
====

1- my introduction 		
		https://www.linkedin.com/in/kodi-prakash-senapati-a95a60182/
	18yr | 10 yr -- corporate training 

2- AI can mimic Human intelligent

3- AI --> application where user or developer need to train the data and write 
			some sort of ml algorithm, dl algorithm to build AI application 
		
	8gb -- 8gb data 
					excel
					csv, image, text, video, audi 
					
			feed these data to the machine & deve write some algorithm
		ml algo, nlp alog, neural network 

AI -- User need to train the data ( feed the data)
vs
GENERATIVE AI -- user no need to train the data 
		data is automatically trained openai , google, meta, deepseek
	model generate new content text, imge generation, video generation 
vs 	
AGENTI AI -->
	agenti ai can take the decission, make decission automatically 

generative ai -- create new content 
agentic ai -- make or take decision automatically

4- everyone install vs code 
		
		
5- AI mimic human intellignece 
		user train the data ( text, speech, image, video)
		user write ml algo, nlp, dl, nn architecture to AI application 
		
	generative ai -- generate new contennt 
				data trained by opeani, google, meta, etc user no need to train the data
		
	agentic ai -- use framework where it connect to llms and make the decission or take 
					the decission automatically
					
6- if you dont understan ( monday 8:30am) 
		experice, fresher, non-tech, tech ( talk to me )
		
7- AGENTIC AI -- We build agents

8- LETS DO THE PROJECT 
	
9- AGENTIC AI FRAMEWORK
	PHIDATA
	LANGCHAIN, LANGGRAPH
	CREW AI 
	AUTOGEN
	SWORN

10- duck-duck go search
----
Lets start the project -->
---

1- google -- type groq 
		https://groq.com/
2- dev console - please login using your gmail.com 
3- create api key -- > 
		you can generate API key --> 
	
	=====GROQ_API_KEY 
	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

4- groq 
		llm model we cannot build using locally 
		we need some interface to build llm 

5- model -- (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
		
	
6- agenti ai framework - PHI DATA ( agentic ai framework)

7- vs code -- install few extren ( pythion)
		folder -- agentic_ai_workshop
		created file -- agentitai.py
		open terming - pip install dotenv 
		
3 code session is live 

		if you dont know vs code please dont workd
		if you know then work 
		session is live -- you can follow the live video 
	
8- pip install phi 

	pip install dotenv
	pip install phi
	store your api key in .env file 

9- every think is recording 

10- we just test the phi framework ( we can test working fine)

11- lets build some agents using help of DUCK DUCK GO SEARCH

	you have nt work before in vs code 
	now you got error 

llm models are pretrain from internet, text, corpus
	duck duck go search also one of the search it provide the safe information 
	
phi -- agentic ai framwork
interface to connect with llm - groq lpu
search tool - duck duck go 


project:1 - we test the phi age
project:2 - we build single agents using 
project:3 -- we build multi agents using openAi ( 
		purchase api key 

steps to build multi agents -->
--
1- platform.openai.com
2- dashboard
3- generate new api key
4- groq api key-- free one ( no need to pay)
	but open ai api_key (paid one)
5- min $5 -- 500rs ( duratioan -- 1yr)
		activate billing and cancel billing 
6- everyone to purchase use openai_api key
7- multiagent

multiagen -- openai 
learn -- opensouce
organizt -- client ( data)
